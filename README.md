# My `.dotfiles`

It changes often as I find more efficient ways but in general some notes:

* [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) + [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
* [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), [neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim)
  [easymotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion) are awesome
* [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) + [ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

##Details
